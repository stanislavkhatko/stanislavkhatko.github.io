Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Stan, a Full-stack web engineer from <a href='/blog/tag/ukraine'>Ukraine</a> ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦, living a nomadic live with family.

Software was something I fall in love since I got my first PC, I was the one to know the right program and solve computer problem instead of spending hours gaming as my friends. I should say it made me a problem solver back then.

Despite my background in Accounting and Management, I found my true passion in web development, and it has been my driving force ever since.

I love <a href='/blog/tag/javascript'>JavaScript</a>, though got major <a href='/blog/tag/php'>PHP</a> background.

When I'm not coding and usually on weekends, you can find me visiting <a href='/blog/tag/wanders'>places</a> around the globe. I believe in people, and I strive to be a good particle of the world.

Feel free to explore my <a href='/projects'>portfolio</a> to see examples of my work, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate!
